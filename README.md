# Superstore profit prediction

Machine Learning project using Super Store data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/sliced-s01e03-DcSXes/overview).

The project provides a direction on how to use regression models from scikit-learn, such as RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, ExtraTreesRegressor, KNeighborsRegressor given a set of numerical and categorical features.
